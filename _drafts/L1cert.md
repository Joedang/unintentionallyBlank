    - I tried to launch at 8pm on Saturday.
    - I had an ignitor failure, so I decided to wait until Sunday morning.
    - Richard gave me a new ignitor, since the vendor already left.
        - He asked me to just give him an ignitor in exchange at the next launch and/or pay it forward.
    - I launched in the morning around 0800 or 0900.
    - I need to get a nice, reliable scale. My scale, Dave's scale, and the RSO scale all gave differnt weights.
    - It was a textbook launch.
        - There was a little bit of aerococking, maybe 5 degrees.
        - Separation occured pretty close to apogee. (I'm not sure if anyone got video.)
