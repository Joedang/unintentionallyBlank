# Neo Amish
Talk about the "boomer mindset", its motivations, and benefits.
It might be worth reading a little bit about Amish philosophy 
and reflecting on the value of "movements" and labels.

Actually, it would be better for me to just go read some anarcho-primitivist literature, lol.

# Reflecting on the value of history
I have a few different examples of things where I've kept, not kept, or lost some history.
It would be nice to spend some time reflecting on that. 
Like, what do I gain/loose from those?
What lessons can I learn about how best to track history?

I could certainly elaborate more on what those GIFs are and why this is
interesting. The hard part is that I would need a way to display math. :/

## Three body problem
https://github.com/Joedang/restricted_three_body_problem
I could go *really* deep into this. 
Frankly, it's kind of weird that I haven't made some publicly presentable thing
about this, since it's something I'm so passionate about.

Actually, MathJax makes this really easy.
I kind of don't want to use it, just because, ya know, web.
But... Munroe is cool with it... and it's been around forever... and math.
I think it's fine. 
It would be good to do some CSS on `<script type="math/tex; mode=display">` to
make it display a little "Hey, you need JS for this math to display properly!"
message.
