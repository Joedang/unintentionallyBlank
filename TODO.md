- Get images working in the RSS feed.  
  Currently, they cut out the baseurl.
  I tried setting the xml:base property and putting atom.xml in posts/
  At some point, I had it working, and I'm not sure what changed.
    - [ ] It might be good to compare to Luke Smith's RSS feed, since his seems 
          to have a working icon.
- Get the favicon or full peanut image to show up as the icon for the feed.  
  Right now, it just shows up as the default icon, which is... okay I guess.
- Implement CSS for the RSS feed. Again, there is an example of this on Luke's 
  site.
- [ ] Change the font sizes in base.scss to be percentage-based, so they will scale with the user's preferred font size.
    - [ ] Make sure this also scales the MathJax stuff.
